## üéØ Learning Path

1. **Beginner**: Parts 1-4 (Fundamentals, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks/Queues)
2. **Intermediate**: Parts 5-8 (Recursion, Trees, Advanced Trees, Graphs)
3. **Advanced**: Parts 9-12 (Sorting/Searching, DP, Advanced Algorithms, Practice)

## üìã Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of C/C++ programming
- Understanding of basic programming concepts
- Familiarity with pointers and memory management

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

- C/C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio)
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code, CLion, Dev-C++)
- Basic understanding of command line

## üìñ How to Use This Guide

1. Start with Part 1 to establish fundamentals
2. Follow the parts sequentially for structured learning
3. Practice coding examples in each part
4. Solve the exercises provided in each section
5. Review and reinforce concepts before moving to the next part

## üéì Learning Tips

- **Practice Regularly**: Code every day, even if it's just 30 minutes
- **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Focus on understanding the logic
- **Visualize**: Draw diagrams to understand data structures
- **Time Yourself**: Practice solving problems within time limits
- **Review Complexity**: Always analyze time and space complexity
